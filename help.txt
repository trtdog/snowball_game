INSTRUCTIONS:

Created by Martin Yang, this snowball game is simple to play.

- To aim, click your crosshair. 
  When you release your mouse, the player throws the snowball aimed at your crosshair

- Your score increases when you hit the toboganner. You win the game if you hit 
  at least 30% of your shots

- When you run out of snowballs, depending on how many times you hit the player, 
  Santa will either drop a sword that penetrates your head or a nice Christmas present.
  You will not know how many times you need to hit the player
  to get the present because Christmas gifts are supposed to be a big surprise!
